# : Agent agent_langgraph

The DataRobot agent template provides a starting point for building custom agents that can be deployed in DataRobot.
This template can be modified to support various frameworks, including CrewAI, LangGraph, Llama-Index, or
a generic base framework that can be customized to use any other agentic framework.

For additional information, examples, and documentation on developing an agent, please see the
[DataRobot Agent Templates](https://github.com/datarobot-community/datarobot-agent-templates).
